# EvilHangman
A hangman game where the computer cheats.

Run the jar in out/artifacts with dictionary.txt in the same directory.

Checks input for repeats, canceling, null input, errors, and more. Exits anytime 'exit' without quotes is inputted. 
If more than 1 letter is inputted, only accepts first character. 

EvilHangmanCMD runs with cmd arguments and EvilHangmanConsole takes console input, but most updated version is EvilHangman or EvilHangman.jar

Test files and jars are not written by me. Everything else is.
